# Yahoo-answers-to-Wayback-Machine

Now that Yahoo! will close the answers site i created this program that takes a list of Yahoo answers links that should be in text file named "yahoo_links.txt" with the links in a list:

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=[something]

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=[something_2]

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=[something_3]

Then, the program will take each page and save it to the Wayback Machine of the Internet Archive

The program will also require a file named wayback_errors.txt and a file named wayback.txt



#### The program uses the powerfull library savepagenow from pastpages
